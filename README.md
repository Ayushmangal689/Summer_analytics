# Summer_analytics
# Overview
This project implements a dynamic pricing system for parking lots using real-time occupancy data.  
It simulates a streaming environment, applies logistic pricing logic, and visualizes the output using Bokeh and Panel.  
The goal is to explore demand-based pricing strategies for smarter urban parking.
For model 1, we have predicted price using a logistic function. Features taken into were the occupancy and capacity and the bokeh plot was developed keeping the datetime on the x axis and the predicted price on the y axis.
